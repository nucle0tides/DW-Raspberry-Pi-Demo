Hi there, I hope you're pumped to fiddle around with a Raspberry Pi and take some pictures! 

**Before** you come on Thursday, I need you to download a few things. 

If you're using Windows, please download [Putty](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html)

I also need you to download [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client) for easier file transfer.

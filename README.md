Hi there, I hope you're pumped to fiddle around with a Raspberry Pi and take some pictures! 

**Before** you come on Thursday, I need you to download a few things. 

- If you're using Windows, please download [Putty](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html)
- I also need you to download [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client) for easier file transfer. 

**Please** do this as it will make the workshop run a lot smoother. 

The overall goal of this workshop is to familiarize ourselves with the Raspberry Pi, Raspberry Pi camera, using a terminal, and to get a taste of Python. Feel free to look at the test code to get an idea of what we're going to be doing. 

*Spoiler Alert* 

A sample of the final product will look something like this (betta fish harassment not guaranteed):
